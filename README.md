***vdhcoapp*** is a multi-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) application providing the 
[Video DownloadHelper](https://downloadhelper.net/) browser add-on with:

- file writing API features that are not available from the browser
- temporary file name generation
- launching default application on a data file
- a build of the [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) video converter

***vdhcoapp*** complies with the [native messaging protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging) and is not intended to be used directly from the command line.

Installer executables for the various platforms are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/mi-g/vdhcoapp/releases).

Note for Linux users: Firefox installations via snap or flathub is not yet supported.  Please install Firefox via the native package manager, e.g. apt package for debian based distributions like Ubuntu.
